Weather App
This Python application retrieves and displays the current weather for a specified location. It also shows the current date and time. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and the PyQt6 library for the GUI.

Installation
To install the app, you'll need to have Python 3.x and PyQt6 installed on your computer. You can install PyQt6 using pip:

Copy code
pip install PyQt6
You'll also need an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. You can get a free API key by signing up for an account at https://openweathermap.org/api.

Once you have Python, PyQt6, and your API key installed, you can run the app by running the weather.py script:

Copy code
python weather.py
Usage
When you run the app, you'll see a window with a text input field and a "Get Weather" button. To use the app, simply type the name of a city or town in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button. The app will retrieve the current weather for the specified location and display it in the window. The current date and time are also displayed at the bottom of the window.

You can use the app to check the weather for any location that is supported by the OpenWeatherMap API. Note that some locations may require a specific format or spelling, so you may need to experiment with different inputs to get accurate results.
